# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description 

This week's challenge was to build a Weather Dashboard that could show a 5 day forecast.
To achieve this, I requested an API in open weather and we used, the set API for a 16 day forecast and converted into 5, using epoch converter to extract an approximate time to represent the weather for that day, and then implemented in a for loop that will deploy the 5 days.
In this project I had the opportunity to explore the use od dynamic JS and learned about backticks and template expression.
